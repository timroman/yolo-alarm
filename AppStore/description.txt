A great day starts the moment you open your eyes.

yolo wakes you gently when your body is ready. Because how you wake up shapes how you show up for life.

Set a wake window and drift off. yolo listens for the subtle sounds of you naturally stirring - the rustling, the shifting, the signs that you're emerging from deep sleep. That's when it gently brings you into your day with a slowly building alarm.

No more groggy mornings. Just you, waking up at the right moment, ready to make the most of today.
